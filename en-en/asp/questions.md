It is much faster, configurable, modular, scalable, extensible, and has cross-platform support. It can work with both .NET Core and .net framework via the .NET standard framework. It is best suitable for developing cloud-based such as web applications, mobile applications, and IoT applications.
ASP.NET Core was primarily designed to make the most important part of the ASP.NET components under the concept learn and the compose framework where the previous ASP.NET components were released under a variety of different licenses periodically, The ASP.NET Core framework is a completely open-sourced framework. Apart from the other parts of the framework of the .NET framework libraries, the ASP.NET Core is primarily designed from scratch to be the platform-agnostic that performs seamlessly. It will allow the ASP.NET Core apps to be deployed on the various platforms or the o/s such as the macOS or Linux-based servers or certain devices.
